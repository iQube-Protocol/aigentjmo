    content: `QryptoCOYN is a compound term combining two key concepts:
    
    Qrypto: Refers to Quantum-ready cryptography and information management. This represents advanced cryptographic systems designed to be secure against both classical and quantum computing attacks, ensuring long-term data protection in the evolving technological landscape.
    
    COYN: An anagram for "Currency Of Your Network" which relates to the value of your data and the network that you do to enrich, collate and curate it. It also relates to the value of your network which is reflected in your data assets. COYN represents the monetization and value creation from data assets and network effects.
    
    Together, QryptoCOYN represents a quantum-ready cryptocurrency framework that transforms data into valuable, tradable assets while maintaining the highest levels of security and privacy.`,

    title: 'iQube COYN Economic Layer',
    content: `The economic engine of the iQube Protocol is the COYN economy, a novel framework that creates data-as-an-asset-backed types of digital currencies.

**COYN Protocol:** At the core of the system, COYN protocol uses Proof-of-Risk and Proof-of-Price frameworks to quantify the value of data in the associated token networks. These proofs assess data value in terms of volume, quality, and risk profile, ensuring that data assets are priced fairly and transparently.

**QryptoCOYN (Utility and Governance Token):** QryptoCOYN serves as the ecosystem's utility and governance token, capturing the value of the network, community, and overall economy. It facilitates staking, governance votes, and protocol upgrades, ensuring that participants are incentivized to maintain high data quality and protocol compliance.

**QryptoCENT (Micro-Stable Coin):** To enable efficient pricing of agent transactions, the protocol introduces QryptoCENT, a micro-stable coin pegged to â‚µ0.01. QryptoCENT bridges the gap between Web2 AI agents, fiat currencies, and the crypto agent economy, providing a seamless on-ramp for traditional AI services to participate in decentralized ecosystems.

**Data-as-an-Asset Standard:** By treating data as a verifiable, risk-priced asset, the protocol aligns incentives for data owners and buyers. The Proof-of-Risk and Proof-of-Price mechanisms ensure that data providers are compensated based on data quality, sensitivity, and usage rights.

**Governance and Treasury Allocation:** A portion of COYN and QryptoCENT reserves is allocated to a decentralized treasury, supporting protocol upgrades, compliance frameworks, and risk management initiatives.`,

    content: `The COYN governance framework establishes a decentralized decision-making structure that empowers stakeholders to guide the evolution of the ecosystem while maintaining the integrity and security of the protocol.

**Governance Token Structure:** QryptoCOYN serves as the primary governance token, with voting power proportional to token holdings. This ensures that stakeholders who have invested in the ecosystem have a voice in its future direction.

**Proposal Mechanism:** Community members can submit governance proposals for protocol upgrades, treasury allocation, risk parameter adjustments, and ecosystem development initiatives. All proposals undergo a structured review process.

**Voting Process:** Governance votes are conducted on-chain using the tokenQube framework, ensuring transparency and immutability. Voting periods are structured to allow adequate deliberation while maintaining operational efficiency.

**Treasury Management:** The decentralized treasury is managed through governance votes, with funds allocated to development, security audits, compliance initiatives, and community programs. Treasury allocation follows strict transparency and accountability standards.

**Risk Committee:** A specialized Risk Committee, elected by governance token holders, oversees risk parameter adjustments and compliance frameworks. This committee ensures that the protocol maintains appropriate risk management while fostering innovation.

**Community Incentives:** Governance participation is incentivized through staking rewards and participation tokens, encouraging active community engagement in the protocol's evolution.`,

**Token Distribution:**
- 40% Community and Ecosystem Development
- 25% Data Provider Rewards
- 20% Protocol Development and Maintenance
- 10% Governance Treasury
- 5% Initial Liquidity and Market Making

**Value Accrual Mechanisms:**
- Transaction fees from data access and AI agent interactions
- Staking rewards for network security and governance participation
- Data quality bonuses for high-value contributions
- Risk assessment premiums for secure data handling

**Inflation and Deflation Controls:**
- Algorithmic supply adjustments based on network utilization
- Burn mechanisms tied to high-value data transactions
- Staking lock-ups to control circulating supply
- Governance-controlled emission schedules

**Micro-Stable Coin Integration:**
QryptoCENT provides price stability for micro-transactions while QryptoCOYN captures long-term value appreciation. This dual-token model ensures both operational efficiency and investment attractiveness.

**Network Effects:**
As more data providers and AI agents join the network, the value of COYN tokens increases through increased transaction volume, data quality improvements, and enhanced network security.`,
